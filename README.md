This project contains a graphical and interactive representation of the Bubble Sort algorithm inspired by some YouTube videos which often are found trending for no discernible reason.

It makes use of [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) for the graphics, so if you wish to compile it for yourself, be sure to download the third party library!
