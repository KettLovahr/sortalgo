This project contains a graphical and interactive representation of the Bubble Sort algorithm inspired by some YouTube videos which often are found trending for no discernible reason.

It makes use of [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) for the graphics and [SunVox](https://warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox/sunvox_lib.php) for the audio, so if you wish to compile it for yourself, be sure to download those third party libraries!
